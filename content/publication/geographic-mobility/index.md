abstract: Individuals’ geographic mobility is positively associated with their socio-economic outcomes. We hypothesize that variation across individuals and their willingness to move is partly determined by their culture of geographic mobility. This culture of geographic mobility is determined by their own childhood experience as well as their parents’ history of geographic mobility. We establish that individuals move more as adults if they moved more as children or if their parents moved more during their lifetime. Moreover, we show that individuals with a higher culture of geographic mobility have better socioeconomic outcomes. The results are robust to accounting for other childhood and household characteristics and hold across siblings. Our results provide a novel cultural channel that may underlie the persistence of economic inequality across generations, gender, and race.
