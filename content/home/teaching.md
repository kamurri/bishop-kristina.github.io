### Selected Student Feedback: 
"It is rare you come across a standout teaching talent like Kristina. I met Kristina when I was an undergraduate student taking an Intermediate Microeconomics (Price Theory) class during the first semester of freshman year. I was particularly impressed by Kristina's teaching abilities. I remember that one particular review session that she taught right before the third exam to be extremely beneficial. I believe she has contributed a lot to me to score a good grade on the third exam and in this class, and I am very thankful. Considering the fact that this is an advanced course that first-year students usually do not take, I believe scoring an A in this course in my first semester at college is a great achievement. Besides that, I find Kristina to be an approachable individual who is willing to help out her hardworking students. I believe it is not easy for a relatively young individual like Kristina to have this kind of capacity. Kristina's excellent abilities have made her a fantastic teaching assistant, and I am happy I had the opportunity of getting taught by her - I hope we get to do it again. I wish her every success in life." -- LinkedIn Review, Alan Jeong
